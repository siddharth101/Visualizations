### Plot Details

Channel Coherence:
- This [interactive](channels_coherence.png) plot shows the highest coherence at each frequency any auxiliary channel has with the primary gravitational wave channel during a given time. We use this information to clean noise around those frequencies. I used mainly plotly to make this plot.

Fast Scatter Tableau:
- This [pdf](FS_Tableau.pdf) contains details on several plots I made using Tableau and how these visualizations helped me in better understand the baneful transient noise Fast Scatter is. Tableau is pretty powerful!

Population US cities:
- I like reading about geography and I worked on this [map](population_us_cities.png) showing the geographical location and population of US cities just for fun.
